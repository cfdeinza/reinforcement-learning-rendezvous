# Render: Display some sort of warning when the chaser enters the keep-out-zone. Draw a red circle:

    if self.absolute_position() < self.target_radius:
        warning = rendering.make_circle(
            radius=self.target_radius/2,
            res=20,
            filled=True
        )
        warning.set_color(1, 0.3, 0.3)
        self.viewer.add_onetime(warning)


# Receding bubble reward function:
    Reward function only penalizes fuel consumption.
    Have an imaginary bubble around the target. The bubble decreases in size over time.
    If the chaser exits the bubble, the episode ends. This incentivizes the chaser to go near the target
    to keep the episode going. Penalize collision? Docking bonus?
